== About ==

Page Forms is an extension to MediaWiki that allows for the
creation of forms that can be used to create and edit pages. It can
work by itself, or in conjuction with two other extensions that
both handle the storage of data: Cargo and Semantic MediaWiki.

For much more information on Page Forms, see the extension
homepage at https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Page_Forms

Notes on installing Page Forms can be found in the file INSTALL.
